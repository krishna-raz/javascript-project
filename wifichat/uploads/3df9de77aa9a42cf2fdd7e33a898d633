It's not how you start, what matters is finishing it strong.

From just participating into the College Hackathon to the WINNER of Asia's Biggest Hackathon, SIH'22 was in itself more than a dream for me and my TEAM VISION.

As a Team Leader I learnt so many new things during this journey, from managing our application to preparing the presentation with my team. 

Our Problem statement for the SIH was to create a Vocational Training Application for Visually impaired people. It was under the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disability(Divyangjan) and Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.

I am extremely thankful to my teammates Ujjwal, Prashant Kumar , Shubham Kumar, Rajnish Puri and Aradhana Kumari for their immense hard work. I am greatly thankful to my seniors Aman Sir & Abu Sir for their constant mentorship and guidance.
Special Mention to our Evaluators
Shakeer Hussain S CLSSGB, CLSSBB, CSPOÂ® ,
Ezhilarasi Chezhiyan &
Vadivel Murugan M
for their continuous support and supervision.
I would also like to take a moment to praise our Event Host Abhjeet and our nodal centre Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, Coimbatore for their wonderful Management and Hospitality.

I am really thankful to each and everyone in my life who helped me directly or indirectly to reach here.

Thank You Smart India Hackathon , MoE's Innovation Cell and AICTE for providing us this wonderful opportunity.
